Welcome to Open Generative Foundation! We are a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting and building the ecosystem of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) to help people leverage their capabilities.

Our foundation has a well-defined architecture, consisting of several layers, each with its own focus and purpose. we have our App Framework, which is focused on developing applications that use LLMs and open Generative Pre-trained Transformers.

We have our ML Frameworks layer, which includes popular libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. This layer provides a solid foundation for building LLMs and GPTs.

The Model layer, where we have popular pre-trained models such as GPT-2, BERT, T5, and others. These models are the backbone of LLMs and GPTs and are essential in developing powerful applications.

Below the Model layer, we have the Dataset layer, which contains pre-trained data that can be used to train LLMs and GPTs.

Finally, we have our Tools layer, which provides a variety of utilities for working with LLMs and GPTs.

Our mission at Open Generative Foundation is to educate people about the blueprint of LLMs and how to leverage their capabilities to improve their lives. We believe that LLMs and GPTs have tremendous potential to transform the way people live and work. By promoting and building this ecosystem, we hope to help more people benefit from this transformative technology.

Thank you for your interest in Open Generative Foundation. If you would like to contribute or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us.
